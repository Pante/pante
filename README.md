### Just your friendly neighbourhood software engineer :eyes:

I'm one of the co-founders of [Forus Labs](https://github.com/forus-labs), having previously worked on [TimeBloc](https://timebloc.app/) until its acquisition. I'm working currently on [Essential](https://essential.app/).

I'm the author and maintainer of:
* [Chimera](https://github.com/Pante/Chimera), a static code generation tool for generating commands in Spigot plugins.
* [Elementary](https://github.com/Pante/Elementary), a suite of JUnit 5 extensions for testing annotation processors.
* [Sugar](https://github.com/forus-labs/cauldron), general utilities to enhance programming in Dart.

I also occasionally publish articles on [Medium](https://matthiasngeo.medium.com) and [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/4534011/matthias-ngeo-pante.html).
