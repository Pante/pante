### Just your friendly neighbour software engineer :eyes:

I'm the author and maintainer of [Chimera](https://github.com/Pante/Chimera) , a static code generation tool for generating commands in Spigot plugins, and [Elementary](https://github.com/Pante/Elementary), a suite of JUnit 5 extensions for testing annotation processors. I currently work at Forus Labs and previously worked on [TimeBloc](https://timebloc.app/) until the acquisition of TimeBloc.
