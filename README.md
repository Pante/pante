## Just your friendly neighbourhood software engineer :eyes:

I'm one of the co-founders of [Forus Labs](https://github.com/forus-labs), having previously created & worked on [TimeBloc](https://timebloc.app/) until the application's acquisition, and [Essential](https://essential.app/). I'm also currently working on [Forui](https://github.com/forus-labs/forui), a minimalistic Flutter UI library, while studying at NTU.

Open Source Projects:
* [Forui](https://github.com/forus-labs/cauldron), a minimalistic Flutter UI library.
* [Sugar](https://github.com/forus-labs/cauldron), an extension to Dart's standard library, including datetimes & timezones.
* [Chimera](https://github.com/Pante/Chimera), a static code generation tool for generating commands in Spigot plugins.
* [Elementary](https://github.com/Pante/Elementary), JUnit 5 extensions for testing annotation processors.

I also occasionally write articles on [Medium](https://matthiasngeo.medium.com).
